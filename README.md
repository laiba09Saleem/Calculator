## 🚀 Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Clear all input with `AC`
- Delete the last digit using `DEL`
- Supports decimal inputs
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

 💡 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the structure
- **CSS3** for styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for logic and interactivity
